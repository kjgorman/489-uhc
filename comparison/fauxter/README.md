#Fauxter

Faux Twitter -- basically just something that polls a server and will display
the author/body pairs in a column on the page. In addition to the Haskell I have
the following implemented:

*  ember js RESTAdapater/model binding/templates
*  jquery ajax get/append
*  twitter flight (although this basically just uses the jquery approach)
*  knockout data binding
Want to add:
*  angular data binding
*  backbone model binding
