## Examples

Some extremely boring examples of apps that will do various boring things to show as
examples for my 489 stuff. A node server to server them as well, obviously.

#### what is this thing

an example of a rich client app that relies a lot on the idea of streaming data, in
this case it's a faked out twitter client; the node server just generates some stupid 
filler text and will give a {author, body}. these then get rendered out in a variety 
of ways. so far I have:

*  ember js RESTAdapater/model binding/templates
*  jquery ajax get/append
*  twitter flight (although this basically just uses the jquery approach)
*  knockout data binding

and I want to add

*  angular data binding
*  backbone model binding

but I'm lazy/have other classes that need doing
