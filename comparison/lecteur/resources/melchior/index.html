            After being hit with this problem in Roy's new type-inference
            engine, I tried figuring out how to represent the algorithm. I
            eventually realised that it looked like a comonadic operation. Turns
            out it's been done before but I couldn't find any complete example.

            Carberp Code Leak Stokes Copycat Fears
          </div>
          <div class="body">
            The source code for “Carberp” — a botnet creation kit coded by a team
            of at least two dozen hackers who used it to relieve banks of an
            estimated $250 million — has been posted online for anyone to
            download. The code leak offers security experts a fascinating and
            somewhat rare glimpse into the malcoding economy, but many also worry
            that its publication will spawn new hybrid strains of sophisticated
            banking malware.

            You know all those files you’ve been creating, editing, moving, and
            renaming? Well, you’ll be glad to know that you can now remove them
            using the web-based interface too! Simply view any file in your
            repository, click the delete button at the top, and commit the
            removal just like any other web-based edit.
